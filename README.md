In this workshop, we built a firewall for the linux operating system using kernel modules and netfilter. 
The firewall does stateless and statefull inspection, and also implements Man In the Middle for complex protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP and others.
The firewall also has a data leak preventation mechanism which is implemented using machine learning and protect the Apache NIFI application against known attacks.
